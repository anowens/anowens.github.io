			The current state of America’s economy is truly unique. Technological innovation is booming and wealth is increasing. Innovation is driving transformation across businesses and industries by increasing output, driving globalization, and decreasing many of the costs associated with production and management. However, the economic benefits being realized are not evenly distributed (Executive Office of the President, 2016; Warschauer, 2003). In fact, the United States is experiencing unprecedented levels of income and wealth inequality, and these disparities are manifesting at all levels of American society.

			    		The current industrial revolution marks a new era of global capitalism and is often referred to as postindustrialism or informationalism (Warschauer, 2003). Unlike the previous revolution, new technologies have raised the productivity of higher-skilled workers compared to lower-skilled workers (skill-biased technical change). In many industries, automation has replaced jobs that are routine and predictable. As the existence of these jobs declines and the demand for more skilled workers increases, inequality continues to rise (Executive Office of the President, 2016).
			    	</p>

			    	<p>
			    		If this trend continues, our nation may see an unprecedented level of economic inequality. In fact, scholars like Brynjolfsson and McAfee (as cited in Executive Office of the President, 2016) predict a new economic shift. A more extreme example of skill-biased technological change, superstar-biased technological change would cause an extremely small percentage of the population to reap most of the new economy’s benefits.

			<h3 class="sub">Pitfalls of U.S. Economic & Political Policy</h3>

			<p class="cont">
				Our economy’s current situation was a long time coming and reflects many of the disparities entrenched in American society. One of the most crucial manifestations is in the ability of citizens to accrue human capital--the knowledge and skills that enable individuals to meet the demands of adulthood (Braun, 2016; Cutter, Litan, & Stangler, 2016; O’Day & Smith, 2016). Human capital varies greatly with income, and children with more capital often have access to a larger number of opportunities and resources. College degrees are an example of human capital, as they improve long-term opportunities for job success (Lerman, 2016). They also represent one of the most important possessions in today’s skill-biased economy, so why do most Americans lack college degrees?
			</p>

			<p class="cont">
				Throughout history, the benefits of education tend to remain consistent with the Theory of Human Capital Investment, which postulates that increases in labor returns associated with a skill, credential, or degree should lead to higher pursuit of--and investments in--that skill. This was observed with the United States’ high school movement until the wage returns associated with having a high school diploma disappeared. Similarly, college degrees are associated with higher returns in today’s economy. However, this return has not diminished since the late 20th century onset of the economic push for workers with higher education experience. Instead, the associated premiums have stabilized (Araya, 2014; Holzer, 2016). 
			</p>

			<p class="cont">
				This stabilization has occurred because the American workforce has not seen a large enough increase in the number of college educated workers (Holzer, 2016). However, when analyzed in the context of income data, this stagnation becomes even more of an enigma. As illustrated by Figure 5.4  (Braun, 2016), there are stark differences in the wages of college educated workers and those with a high school diploma (or less). In fact, wage gaps between the two have almost doubled (Holzer, 2016). 
			</p>

			<div class="cont"><img src="public/wages.PNG" id="wage">
			</div>
			

			<p class="cont">
				With college graduates earning so much more, how do we explain the disparities in educational attainment? First, we must examine class in the United States. Throughout the nation, over 16 million children live in poverty and suffer from a lack of quality resources (O’Day & Smith, 2016). Their socioeconomic status is detrimental to their future outcomes, because poverty and other associated factors (i.e. residential segregation, low levels of parent education, limited access to support systems, and lack of quality preschool programs) all negatively affect educational attainment. These factors and their increasing influence are of grave concern in today’s digital economy.
			</p>

			<p class="cont">
				Ultimately, the U.S. has failed to adequately address these underlying issues. Policies that reduce unionization, fail to increase the minimum wage, fail to address the rising cost of college, and favor part-time work undergird rapidly rising inequality. To say rising income inequality is an inevitable part of technological change is inaccurate. A number of advanced countries have seen similar economic changes, but the U.S. has witnessed the greatest increase in income inequality and consistently maintains the highest levels of income inequality). The difference lies in other countries’ policies and expenditures. In fact, research shows that the United States spends far less on active labor market programs (i.e. training and assistance) than most developed countries and that amount continues to decline (Executive Office of the President, 2016; Warschauer, 2003).
			</p>

			<p class="cont">
				Without the human capital, technological resources, and financial means, many poor individuals are unable to gain the knowledge and technical skills needed to remain relevant members of today’s workforce. This begs the question: how do we prepare citizens for work in a digital economy if they do not have adequate and equitable access to technology and education?
			</p>
		</div>

	</div>

	<div id="implications">
		<h1 class="change">Implications</h1>
		<p class="cont">
			Economic innovation has presented us with an incredibly complex problem to solve. The very technologies driving economic change are not accessible to the citizens who need it most. As a result, they are unable to adequately train and prepare for the changes and problems this wave of technology will usher in. 
		</p>

		<div class="sxn">
			<h3 class="sub">The Digital Divide: Fuel for the Fire</h3>
			<p class="cont">
				Access to and proficiency with the Internet and technology are crucial for social and economic mobility. However, a great deal of Americans lack the physical access, knowledge, and strategic skills necessary to thrive in the 21st century economy. Most often, this digital divide and other achievement gaps begin in elementary school and continue to grow until adulthood (Conceicao & Martin, 2016). By the time students are old enough to enter the workforce, they will be at a significant disadvantage. Ultimately, this will lead to higher unemployment rates and worker underutilization.
			</p>

			<p class="cont">
				Our understanding of disparities in technology access have changed over the years and can be broadly characterized by three paradigms.

			<p class="cont">
			Initially, the American public education system was created and expanded to meet the needs of an industrial economy (Araya, 2014; Cutter, Litan, & Stangler, 2016). This expansion had measurable benefits in our workforce and economy, and many of the original structural elements (i.e. age-based grades, classroom based model, single-teacher instruction, predetermined and pre-sequenced curriculum, etc.) and skills (i.e. numeracy, literacy) remain in place today (Araya, 2014;  Waks, 2014; Executive Office of the President, 2016). However, this structure is inadequate for our shifting economy. Artificial intelligence is changing the nature of work, and it should be met with a change in the way we educate our citizens.
			</p>
			<p class="cont">
			A focus on competence-based skills is no longer sufficient. To prepare students for the workforce and provide them with social and economic mobility, 21st century skills and literacies should be integrated into school curriculum (Jordan, 2010).

			<p class="cont">In response to a growing industrial economy, the United States invested in the improvement and expansion of public education. This expansion increased the workforce population, enhanced labor productivity, and fueled widespread economic growth (Chaudry, 2016). Today we face a different type of economic disruption and our rigid approaches to schooling are in need of a dramatic transformation. For education to yield the widespread economic benefits we hope to see, we must increase its funding, alter its structure, integrate new technologies, and update standards-based curriculum models. An education system prepared to deal with our 21st century economy will be flexible, innovative, and improve human capital development and economic growth.
